How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you 
see the bug that was introduced?
-Helped shorten the process of searching
-Only provided me with the lines that had changed
-Cut down the number of comparisons

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file

-Easy to see how much we have improved
-Can access previous versions of code that can be reused

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing 
when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having 
versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
-Can decide how much progress to save after
-Have greater control of what changes will be saved

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow 
saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google 
Docs, treat each file separately
-Git is for large coding projects which may consist of multiple files
-Docs is for basic word documents. Each document is independent file

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the 
history of files?
-git diff shows the changes made from one version of a file tot he next.
